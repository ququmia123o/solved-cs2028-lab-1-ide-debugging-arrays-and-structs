The objective of this homework is to get familiar with the editing and compilation environment, modify a simple C++ program, design a Struct and implement it in a C++ program, prepare a well documented report and submit to the lab instructor.

<strong>Task 1:  </strong>Familiarize yourself with the IDE.

<ol>

 <li>Download and install the IDE of your choice. In case you have not chosen any IDE yet, try downloading Visual Studio.  The community edition is located at</li>

</ol>

<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/</a><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">.</a>  Make sure you include the C++ language during the setup.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Create a new project. You can name this whatever you like (but a descriptive naming is recommended).</li>

 <li>Try to use the code from Gaddis program 8-6 as our first example. You may find that the source code of the text can be found and be downloaded from <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_gaddis_sowcpp_cs_8/244/62625/16032053.cw/index.html">http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_gaddis_sowcpp_cs_8/244/62625/16032053.cw/index.html</a><a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_gaddis_sowcpp_cs_8/244/62625/16032053.cw/index.html">.</a></li>

 <li>Create a breakpoint on line 41 and step through the code until you have displayed two rows of products on the screen.</li>

 <li>Take a screen shot of the output screen and the IDE to include in your lab report. <strong>Task 2: </strong></li>

 <li>Create a new project.</li>

 <li>Copy the provided code from the file Lab1-Task2.cpp into your project.</li>

 <li>Compile and run the code.</li>

 <li>Your user has noted the following errors. Fix them.

  <ol>

   <li>The division in the output is incorrect</li>

   <li>The amounts in the division are incorrect. One of the values is a really large negative number that looks like garbage.</li>

   <li>The total is 0 but it shouldn’t be.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Submit the corrected source code and include a screen shot of the output in your lab report.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Task 3:  </strong>Structures.

<ol>

 <li>Browse Chapter 11(Sections 1 through 5) of Gaddis’ text on structured data.</li>

 <li>Reuse the project from task 1.</li>

 <li>Create a structure to replace the 4 arrays in the program (id, units, prices, sales).</li>

 <li>Modify the code in the main function to have a single products array of type defined in step 2.</li>

 <li>Modify the code in the rest of the program to use the single products array rather than the 4 original arrays.</li>

 <li>Submit your working (meaning you tested and removed all bugs) code and include a screen shot of the output in your lab report.</li>

</ol>
